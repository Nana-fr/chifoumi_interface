This is my first online web application using JavaScript as part of my Web Developer Training Course at AFPA.


It's a famous game where two players choose between __Rock__, __Paper__ and __Scissors__. The winner is the one who has chosen the strongest item:

* __Rock__ beats __Scissors__
* __Scissors__ beat __Paper__
* __Paper__ beats __Rock__

If both players choose the same item, it is a __draw__.


In this project, the second player is played by the computer. When the first player (the computer's user) accesses the website, he will see a __welcoming message__ asking for __his name__. 
His name should be at least 2 characters long and 20 at most, without any number and space in it.
The program will then address the player by his name and ask him to __choose an item__. (His choice is case-insensitive)
After checking his answer is valid, the __computer's choice__ will be announced and finally, __who is the winner__ of this round.
When one of the player gets 3 victories the game ends, and the player can choose to play again.
